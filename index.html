    <panel header="Some things to consider when preparing for the talk" expanded="" no-close="">
      <span id="tips-roundA">
<p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em> component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
<li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li></ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find a WIIFY</strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level.
For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code> is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‚Äòthere is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now‚Äô can be a turn off.<br>
If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
<ul>
<li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>.</li>
      <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>CtA</code>&quot;
        <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, switch to X!&quot;</span></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).</p>
        <table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Roadmap</th>
              <th>Key points</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>What is X</code><br> <code>Demo of X</code><br> <code>Benefits of X</code></td>
              <td><code>X is fast</code><br> <code>X is free</code><br> <code>X is getting popular</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Design the slide content.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br> Peers reviewing
            a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.</li>
          <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
            <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
            <blockquote>
              <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.</span></p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big <code>Thank You</code> or <code>Q&amp;A</code>)</li>
          <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Start the talk with a <em>PUNCH</em>, <em>WIIFY</em>, and the <em>Roadmap</em></strong>. <mark>Avoid the traditional <code>My name is A, my topic is B</code> type start.</mark></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance</strong>.</p>

        <h4 id="book-chapter">Book Chapter</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>We are going to build a <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/learningresources">collection of learning resources</a> (an online book of sorts)to help others learn the areas you are learning yourself.</li>
          <li>You are expected to make periodic PRs to create/enhance the relevant pages as you learn the topic.</li>
          <li>Submitting PRs
            <ul>
              <li>Minimally, you are expected to merge one PR by week 7 and one more by week 13.</li>
              <li>While you have write access to the repo, use your own fork to submit PRs.</li>
              <li>Improving existing content is as valuable as adding new content.</li>
              <li>You can create PRs without corresponding issues.</li>
              <li>Please get the PRs reviewed and approved by a peer before requesting prof's review. You can also request reviews from past contributors of the repo (especially if you are improving an existing topic) but there is no guarantee that they will
                be available to review.</li>
              <li>Aim to get some content merged before mid-semester break.</li>
              <li>If there are others in the class working on the same topic, coordinate among yourselves to avoid duplication of work.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Writing the 'book chapter':
            <ul>
              <li>Despite using the name ‚Äòbook chapter‚Äô for this deliverable (for the lack of a better term), it is not a normal book. It‚Äôs more of an online repository of learning resources. Therefore, don‚Äôt try to follow the structure of normal text books.</li>
              <li>Related to the above, there‚Äôs no need to use a very formal tone that you see in some text books. Instead, prefer an informal tone you would use in a blog post or an stackoverflow question.</li>
              <li>The book is aimed at typical SE students, but not necessarily SE students in our school.</li>
              <li>Don‚Äôt assume the reader has any prior knowledge of the topic. Just because it is covered in a core module in our school does not mean it will be known to every reader.</li>
              <li>Try to include content that is highly useful and relevant to the reader. The objective is to help the reader, not to demonstrate your expertise. The latter is only a by-product of the former.</li>
              <li>Do not re-invent the wheel by writing a lot of original content. Instead, give a brief high-level view and point to other existing resources that you recommend the reader to use. The value you add is in the form of assembling <strong>a curated list of the best resources into a meaningful sequence, possibly with commentary</strong>,
                NOT creating new content.
                <ul>
                  <li>Do not aim to 'teach' how to use the X (assuming your book chapter is about the tool/technology X) in the style of a tutorial. It the tool is worth learning, we can be sure that there are good tutorials about it already.</li>
                  <li>Do not aim too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader. The less piror knowledge you assume, the wider your reader base becomes.</li>
                  <li>Instead, cover things such as these:
                    <ul>
                      <li>WHAT is X? How does it fit into the bigger landscape of SE. Describe it relative to topics the reader is likely to know.</li>
                      <li>HOW does X work? HOW is X being used? This is a simple high-level overview of the tool to give the reader some concrete sense of X (as opposed to limiting to an entirely abstract description). It's useful to give concrete examples
                        such as code examples. Avoid giving too many details though, as you are not trying to 'teach' how to use X.</li>
                      <li>WHY X? Describe benefits of X to make the reader interested in X. Try to give a balanced view of by mentioning also WHY NOT X i.e., mention both advantages and disadvantages</li>
                      <li>How to GET STARTED with X? Point to resources that can help the reader get started with X. Instead of just listing a lot of links, give helpful commentary about each link so that the reader can decide which resources are more relevant
                        to her needs.</li>
                      <li>How to learn MORE about X? More advance/in-depth resources about X the reader can refer.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>While we try to avoid point to other resources instead of reinvent the wheel, note that the reader should still get a complete and useful feature even if she does not refer any of the given links. i.e., make the content self-contained
                    and grounded/concrete instead of too abstract to be of much use. You may repeat/adapt content snippets from other resources (instead of simply giving a link) with proper attribution.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Instead of bullet points, use other suitable visual structures <span class="dimmed">e.g., a flow chart</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Make the point clear</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask yourself &quot;what is the point I want to make in this slide?&quot; Once you have determined the point, ask yourself &quot;can I improve the slide to make the point clearer?&quot;</li>
            <li>Use <em>assertion-evidence</em> type slides rather that <em>topic-content</em> type where applicable.</li>
            <li>Ensure every technical term used is either known to the audience or you define it explicitly. If you are not sure if the audience know the definition, <em>slip in</em> the definition casually to your explanations.</li>
            <li>Demo/describe your solution early to avoid setting expectations too high. <span class="dimmed">If you spend a lot of time explaning the problem or criticising competing solutions, audience expectations of your own solution might climb too high.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Animate meaningfully</strong>: Use animations/transitions to enhance the meaning of your slide content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Use the Click-Look-Recall technique</strong> instead of using cue cards:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that you know the sequence of your talking points in advance.</li>
            <li>Map each point to a click on your slide, which should add a visual cue onto the slide that reminds you of the point you are supposed to talk about.</li>
            <li>During delivery, <em>look</em> at the screen as you <em>click</em>, and use the visual cue to <em>recall</em> the point.</li>

      </ul>
    </panel>
    <panel header="%%For reference: Tips from round A%%" no-close="">
      <div>
        <p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em> component
                will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
              <li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Find a WIIFY</strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level. For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code>              is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‚Äòthere is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now‚Äô can be a turn off.<br> If
              you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Choose some key points that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>.</li>
              <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>CtA</code>&quot;
                <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, switch to X!&quot;</span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Decide the talk roadmap (aka agenda, or promise). The may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. Roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather than answers).</p>
            <table class="markbind-table table table-bordered table-striped">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Roadmap</th>
                  <th>Key points</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>What is X</code><br> <code>Demo of X</code><br> <code>Benefits of X</code></td>
                  <td><code>X is fast</code><br> <code>X is free</code><br> <code>X is getting popular</code></td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Design the slide content.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. This can be avoided if you rehearse the talk with a peer first.<br> Peers reviewing
                a talk rehearsal: please listen to the talk as if you know nothing about the topic so that you can spot those holes.</li>
              <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
                <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big <code>Thank You</code> or <code>Q&amp;A</code>)</li>
              <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Start the talk with a <em>PUNCH</em>, <em>WIIFY</em>, and the <em>Roadmap</em></strong>. <mark>Avoid the traditional <code>My name is A, my topic is B</code> type start.</mark></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance</strong>.</p>

          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Important elements of the talk are captured prominently in slides
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Ensure WIIFY, Roadmap, start/end of sections of the Roadmap, and each keypoint are captured as separate slides or as noticeable visual elements</li>
            <li>üí° Use words <code>Key point</code> in text so that they are hard to miss<br>
              <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>KEY POINT: Java is verbose!</code></span></li>
            <li>üí° use a different (and more prominent) design for important slides and key elements<br>
              <span class="dimmed">e.g., use a brighter background, bigger font size</span></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Last slide is used to good effect
          <ol>
            <li>üí° at least it should contain key points and the call-to-action</li>
            <li>üí° as the last slide should contain the essence of the talk, it is ok to be 'crowded'</li>
            <li>üí° you may want to include your contact details in the last slide too</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Slides optimized to convey the point, and help your delivery
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Write down in slide notes the point(s) a slide is supposed to convey. Each slide should have at least a main point, and possibly some sub points. e.g.,
              <pre class="hljs"><code>Java is still the most popular language today.
* Java positions lead job vacancies.
* Highest percentage of devices support JVM.
* All fortune 500 companies use Java for their enterprise systems.
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>üí° If possible, use the assertion-evidence format to bring out the main point. i.e., show the main point as the slide title.<br>
              <span class="dimmed">e.g., the slide title can be <code>Java is still the most popular language today.</code> (i.e., the main point) instead of <code>Java popularity</code> (i.e., a phrase/topic)</span></li>
            <li>üí° For each sub point, ensure there is a corresponding click.<br>
              <span class="dimmed">e.g., the slide should have at least three clicks so that you can use the click-look-recall technique as a prompt to talk about each of the three sub points.</span></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Minimum use of jargon
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Format jargon in a different way e.g., use a different font so that you remember to define them. Alternatively, put the definition on the slide.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Meaningful animations
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Use meaningful slide transitions e.g., use a more drastic transition when moving from one major section to another.</li>
            <li>üí° When possible, gradually remove/introduce elements into a slide so that the audience can maintain context i.e., minimize drastic change of scenery.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>üéØ Start with a PUNCH (instead of traditional self-intro)
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Open with a brief greeting, and jump starlight into your PUNCH</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ WIIFY and Roadmap clearly communicated.
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Use clear 'marker' phrases to draw attention to these important elements of the talk. e.g., <code>&quot;I think this is a very important topic to you because ...&quot;</code> <code>&quot;In the next few minutes, I'm going to talk about (a)... (b)... and (c)&quot;</code></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Each key point is clearly made
          <ol>
            <li>üí° When the key slide comes up, use the marker phrase <code>&quot;So, the key point here is ...&quot;</code> to draw attention to it.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>üéØ Finish by reiterating key points, and call-to-action.
          <ol>
            <li>üí° Follow the call-to-action with a clear <code>&quot;Thank you!&quot;</code> and if applicable, <code>&quot;I'm ready for your questions&quot;</code> to indicate the end of your talk.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
